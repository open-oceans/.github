# Open Oceans on Github! 🌊🔍

Dive into a world of ocean science. 🌏 My hope is to bring together a treasure trove of tools and open ocean datasets, making them easily accessible for the entire ocean science community. 🌐 Here, you'll find a mix of tools and datasets – some crafted by me, and others generously contributed by ocean enthusiasts from all around. 🤝

The Github organization is meant to establish a comprehensive resource hub for the ocean science community, with a focus on providing access to a diverse range of tools and open ocean datasets. Open Oceans seeks to facilitate collaboration, enhance accessibility, and foster knowledge exchange in the domain of oceanography. All this while being dedicated to curating a repository that combines both open source tools and datasets, developed by me, and contributions from a community of ocean science enthusiasts and collaborators.

I am committed to promoting and supporting various facets of ocean science, spanning from marine biology to climate studies, and aim to provide better tools and a datasets for oceanographic research.
